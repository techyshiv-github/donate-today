                <h1>Letâ€™s Help Those Who Are More In Need</h1>
                <p>Bangladesh has been hit with the worst flooding in 100 years. Thousands of children are at risk,
                    threatened by a high
                    risk of drowning, disease, and malnutrition. More than 36,000 children are crowded into emergency
                    flood
                    shelters.
                    Families and children are trapped at home waiting for boats to bring relief. Roads and homes have
                    been
                    submerged, power
                    stations are down, and over 380 schools have been closed or impacted.</p>
